**About The Cordial Eye**

The Cordial Eye Gallery and Artist Space is an alternative space that utilizes the arts as a meeting point for community building.

**Mission**

The Cordial Eye Gallery and Artist Space recognizes that cultural institutions are not neutral in terms of upholding white supremacy and patriarchy. We are dedicated to dismantling systems of oppression in our community by creating space for marginalized groups to gather, experiment, exhibit work, and tell their stories.
